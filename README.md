# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: The import numpy as np-This line imports the NumPy library and gives it the alias np. NumPy is essential for numerical and matrix operations in Python.
### Step 2: Defining the Matrix A.
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: print the rank of matrix.
## Program:
```

import numpy as np
A = [[3,2,5],[1,1,2],[3,3,6]]
B = np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)
print(B)
```
## Output:
